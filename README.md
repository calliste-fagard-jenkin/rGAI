# rGAI
Generalised Abundace Index for seasonal invertibrates

# Description
The rGAI package is an extension of functionality provided by 
\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.12506}{Dennis
\textit{et al} (2016)}. The package provides a user interface for calculating a
Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) for seasonal invertebrates, with multiple
options for covariate inclusion, seasonal flight patterns and observed count
distributions, along with the ability to conduct bootstraps to obtain measures
of uncertainty for estimated parameter and GAI values.

# Installation Instructions
rGAI can be installed with the `devtools` R library as follows:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("calliste-fagard-jenkin/rGAI", quiet = F)
```

# Package Vignette
A full tutorial covering the package's range of features can be found in the /vignettes and /examples folders.
