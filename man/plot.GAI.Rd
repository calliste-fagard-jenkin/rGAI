\usage{
\method{plot}{GAI}(
  GAIobj,
  all_sites = F,
  quantiles = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95),
  scale_by_N = T,
  colours = hcl(h = seq(15, 375, length = 11), l = 65, c = 100)[1:10] \%>\% rep(10)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GAIobj}{An object produced by using the summary.GAI function an a model
output produce by fit_GAI.}

\item{all_sites}{If TRUE, the curves for every single site are plotted rather
than a smooth through the curves from each site. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{quantiles}{For when all_sites = F, a vector of quantiles that will each
be used to produce a curve. Defaults to c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95)}

\item{scale_by_N}{If TRUE, then the seasonal flight component for each site
will be scaled by that site's estimated site total. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{colours}{A list of colour values to be used for plotting different
curves. Defaults to the GGplot default 10 colour palette repeated 10 times to
accommodate up to 100 sites (even when ggplot is not used)}

\item{shift}{An optional parameter which can be used to shift the location
of the key when using base graphics, as this can often be misplaced.}

\item{useGGplot}{If TRUE, will use GGplot to produce the graphics instead of
the standard base R graphics}
}
\description{
Prints the flight path curves of a fitted GAI model with options to scale
by estimated site total, and avoid plotting all sites by smoothing through
results for each sites by taking a given quantile at each time point
